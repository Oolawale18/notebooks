Included are the Latitude and Longitude coordinates of each Neighborhood.\nhttps://geo.nyu.edu/catalog/nyu_2451_34572\n\n\n\n* As the Restaurant is involved with food, we looked into some data for markets like the DOHMH Farmer's market. (Also note that Farmer's market are places/sites used by local or regional producers for the direct sale of farm products to consumers. They are wholesalers of fresh foods and other minimally processed foods.     Here is a link of DOHMH \nhttps://data.cityofnewyork.us/dataset/DOHMH-Farmers-Markets-and-Food-Boxes/8vwk-6iz2 ,    Along with GrowNYC fresh food box Program link. https://www.grownyc.org/greenmarketco/foodbox\n\n\n\n* In addition to the markets, We scraped the internet for some important data such as --- New York Population: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City , ---The Economy of New York City: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_New_York_City , --- New York City Portal and Demographics: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:New_York_City , ---Cuisines of New York City:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuisine_of_New_York_City , and Lastly, a list of the starred restaurants in the City: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Michelin_starred_restaurants_in_New_York_City\n\n\n* Remember that Foursquare API would be used for the geographical coordinates and to get more information that would enable us to get insights into the Neighborhood : https://foursquare.com"
